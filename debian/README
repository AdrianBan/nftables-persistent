nftables-persistent and its plugins
------------------------------------

nftables-persistent is used to load and save filter rules.
This tool cames with a nft plugin.

Commands are run from nftables-persistent. For example, to save
all filter rules:

   nftables-persistent save

or to load them:

   nftables-persistent start

For more details, see `man nftables-persistent`.

The system service will try to load rules at startup if enabled, but by
default it will not flush rules at shutdown. This behaviour can be changed
by editing /etc/default/nftables-persistent.
